Low-Rank and Sparse Representation Gaussian (LRSR-G) and Relaxed (LRSR-R)
========
The code in this toolbox implements the "Robust Transfer Subspace Learning Based on Low-Rank and Sparse Representation for Bearing Fault Diagnosis".

Quick Testing
--
"Single to Image" is used to convert one-dimensional signals to images and extract features of images. Then run the codes in "LRSR-G" and "LRSR-R" to train models using the data from "Single to Image".
